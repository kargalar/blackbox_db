# Review System Fixes - Test Guide

## Issues Fixed âœ…

### 1. **Reviews not loading in content page and profile page**
- **Problem**: Database queries were incorrect, missing proper joins
- **Fix**: Rewrote `getContentReviews()` and `getUserReviews()` methods to properly fetch data

### 2. **Like count going to -1**
- **Problem**: Local UI updates without checking actual database state
- **Fix**: Now fetches actual like count from database after each toggle

### 3. **Like counts not being saved**
- **Problem**: `review_likes` table might not exist
- **Fix**: Created migration file `004_review_likes_table.sql`

## Changes Made

### Database Migration
- Created `supabase/migrations/004_review_likes_table.sql`
- This creates the `review_likes` table with proper relationships and RLS policies

### Migration Service Updates
- `getContentReviews()`: Now properly fetches like counts and user like status
- `getUserReviews()`: Updated to work with correct user ID and fetch like data
- Both methods now handle null values gracefully

### UI Updates
- `review_item.dart`: Now fetches actual like count after toggle
- `profile_reviews.dart`: Same fix applied for consistency

## Testing Steps

1. **Run the migration first**:
   ```sql
   -- In Supabase dashboard, run the 004_review_likes_table.sql migration
   ```

2. **Test content page reviews**:
   - Go to any content page
   - Reviews should now load properly
   - Like counts should start at 0 and increment/decrement correctly

3. **Test profile page reviews**:
   - Go to profile page
   - Reviews should load with user's actual rating and favorite status
   - Like functionality should work without going negative

4. **Test like persistence**:
   - Like a review
   - Refresh the page
   - Like count should persist

## Database Schema Required

Make sure these tables exist in Supabase:
- `review` (existing)
- `app_user` (existing)
- `user_content_log` (existing)
- `review_likes` (new - from migration)

## Verification Checklist
